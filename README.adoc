Builds malware analysis Windows virtual machines so that you don't have to.

https://github.com/gosecure/malboxes


== Requirements

* Python 3.3+
* https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html[Packer]
* vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] or an vSphere / ESXi server


=== Minimum specs for the build machine

* At least 5 GB of RAM
* VT-X extensions strongly recommended

=== Fedora

    dnf install ruby-devel gcc-c++ zlib-devel
    vagrant plugin install winrm winrm-fs

=== Debian

    apt install vagrant git python3-pip
    
=== Ubuntu

    apt install git python3-pip

=== ArchLinux

    pacman -Sy vagrant packer python-pip git

== Installation

=== Linux/Unix

* Install git and packer using your distribution's packaging tool
  (packer is sometimes called packer-io)
* Install vagrant from their website : https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html (Installing from some distributions' packaging tools have caused issues). 
* `pip install` malboxes:
+
    sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/varthdader/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes

=== Windows

NOTE: Starting with Windows 10 Hyper-V is always running below the operating
system. Since VT-X needs to be operated exclusively by only one Hypervisor
https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes/issues/39[this causes VirtualBox (and
malboxes) to fail]. To disable Hyper-V and allow
VirtualBox to run, issue the following command in an administrative command
prompt then reboot: `bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off`

==== Using Chocolatey

The following steps assume that you have https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey]
installed. Otherwise, follow the <<Manually,manual installation procedure>>.

* Install dependencies:
+
    choco install python vagrant packer git virtualbox
+
* Refresh the console
+
    refreshenv
+
* Install malboxes:
+
    pip3 install setuptools
    pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/varthdader/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes

==== Manually

* Install https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox],
  https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant] and
  https://git-scm.com/downloads[git]
* https://www.packer.io/downloads.html[Install Packer], drop the packer binary
  in a folder in your user's PATH like `C:\Windows\System32\`
* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Install Python 3] (make sure to add
  Python to your environment variables)
* Open a console (Windows-Key + cmd)
+
    pip3 install setuptools
    pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/varthdader/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes

=== To deploy on AWS (optional)
Run this command after normal installation:
    
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws

NOTE: The AWS feature has only been tested on Linux for the moment and EC2 does not support 32-bit desktop version of Windows 10.

== Usage

=== Box creation

This creates your base box that is imported in Vagrant. Afterwards you can
re-use the same box several times per sample analysis.

Run:

    malboxes build <template>

You can also list all supported templates with:

    malboxes list

This will build a Vagrant box ready for malware investigation you can now
include it in a Vagrantfile afterwards.

For example:

    malboxes build win10_x64_analyst

<<_configuration,The configuration section>> contains further information about
what can be configured with malboxes.


=== Per analysis instances

    malboxes spin win10_x64_analyst <name>

This will create a `Vagrantfile` prepared to use for malware analysis. Move it
into a directory of your choice and issue:

    vagrant up

By default the local directory will be shared in the VM on the Desktop. This
can be changed by commenting the relevant part of the `Vagrantfile`.

For example:

    malboxes spin win7_x86_analyst 20160519.cryptolocker.xyz

=== To deploy on AWS (optional)

Malboxes can upload and interact with a VM on the Amazon Web serivces. To do so, follow these steps:

. Malboxes will need a S3 bucket on AWS to upload the VM before converting it to an AMI (Amazon Machine Image). If you don't have one, 
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/s3backup/step-1-create-bucket.html[create one now.]

. Your instance also requires a link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#CreatingSecurityGroups[security group] with at least a rule allowing inbound connections for WinRM (Type: WinRM-HTTP, Protocol: TCP, Port Range: 5985, Source: host's public IP).

. Next, you need a `vmimport` service role configured.
  Follow the section named _VM Import Service Role_ of https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html[this guide].
  These steps must be performed with an account that has `iam:CreateRole` and `iam:PutRolePolicy` permissions.

. If the <<_configuration,default config>> is used, change the hypervisor to aws and fill the mandatory options related. Otherwise, be sure to add all the options about AWS to your custom config.

. Finally, you can follow the same steps described in the <<Box creation>> and the <<Per analysis instances>> sections to launch your instance!

NOTE: The AMI import can take a very long time (about an hour), however you can verify the status of the task by doing <<AMI import status, this>>. At the moment, only one AMI can be build per template.

==== AMI import status
Install awscli using pip:

    pip install awscli

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration[Configure] awscli with:

    aws configure

Then run:

    aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks 

==== RDP

To connect to an instance on the cloud using RDP, run this command at the same location of your `Vagrantfile`: 

    vagrant rdp -- /cert-ignore

For this to work, the instance will require a security group allowing RDP inbound connections (Type: RDP, Protocol: TCP, Port Range: 3389, Source: host's public IP).

NOTE: You can safely ignore the following error because rsync is not yet implemented: `No host IP was given to the Vagrant core NFS helper. This is an internal error that should be reported as a bug.` 


==== Stopping an Instance

To stop an instance on the cloud, run this command at the same location of your `Vagrantfile`:

    vagrant halt

== Configuration

Malboxes' configuration is located in a directory that follows usual operating
system conventions:

* Linux/Unix: `~/.config/malboxes/`
* Mac OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/malboxes/`
* Win 7+: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\malboxes\malboxes\`

The file is named `config.js` and is copied from an example file on first run.
link:malboxes/config-example.js[The example configuration] is documented.

=== ESXi / vSphere support

Malboxes uses virtualbox as a back-end by default but since version 0.3.0
support for ESXi / vSphere has been added. Notes about the
link:docs/esx-setup.adoc[steps required for ESXi / vSphere support are
available]. Since everyone's setup is a little bit different do not hesitate
to open an issue if you encounter a problem or improve our documentation via a
pull request.

=== Profiles

We are exploring with the concept of _profiles_ which are stored separately
than the configuration and can be used to create files, alter the registry or
install additional packages. See
link:malboxes/profile-example.js[profile-example.js] for an example
configuration. This new capacity is experimental and subject to change as we
experiment with it.

=== AWS security groups

Currently, Malboxes does not support the automatic creation of the security groups, so you'll have to use the AWS console to create yours. However, using the library link:https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html[Boto3] there should be a way to implement this.

== Credits

After I had the idea for an improved malware analyst workflow based on what
I've been using for development on Linux servers (Vagrant) I quickly Googled
if someone was already doing something in that regard.

I found the https://github.com/m-dwyer/packer-malware[packer-malware] repo on
github by Mark Andrew Dwyer. Malboxes was boostrapped thanks to his work which
helped me especially around the areas of `Autounattend.xml` files.
